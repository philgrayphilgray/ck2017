# Webpack/Babel/Pug/Sass/Autoprefixer Starter

+ HTML/PUG
+ SASS
+ ES6/Vanilla JS
+ Webpack (with a little setup help from [AriaFallah's intro tutorial](https://github.com/AriaFallah/WebpackTutorial/tree/master/part2))
+ Autoprefixer

## To Do
+ HMR with PUG? (if possible)
+ Image compression with [image-webpack-loader](https://github.com/tcoopman/image-webpack-loader)
+ Icon sprites with [webpack-svgstore-plugin](https://github.com/mrsum/webpack-svgstore-plugin) or [svg-sprite-loader](https://github.com/kisenka/svg-sprite-loader)
+ [Font and Image loading](https://ajsharp.gitbooks.io/webpack-react-and-babel-the-next-gen-frontend-too/content/images_and_fonts.html)
