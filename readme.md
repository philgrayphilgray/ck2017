# CK Redesign 2017
The primary goal of the redesign is to incorporate new images and enhance user experience. The mobile-first, desktop-enhanced design will specifically make it easier for end users to:
+ Make a reservation
+ View restaurant hours
+ View menus
+ View address/contact information
+ View photos
+ Read announcements
+ Read other info (history/products/reviews)
+ View and interact with social media

To meet these requirements, we'll try to avoid dependencies, with the exception of the following tools:
+ HTML/PUG
+ SASS
+ ES6/Vanilla JS
+ Webpack (with a little setup help from [AriaFallah's intro tutorial](https://github.com/AriaFallah/WebpackTutorial/tree/master/part2))
+ Autoprefixer

The initial mockup will be designed with:
+ Figma, Adobe XD, (TMI: no money for Sketch)

The secondary goal is to add blogging functionality and make it possible for non-technical staff to easily update the site:
+ Update hours
+ Upload and update menus
+ Upload and update photos
+ Post announcements

To meet the secondary requirements, we'll use open-source software or free-tier services, or some combination such as:
+ Jekyll
+ Codeship or a similar service
+ Dropbox
+ Firebase
+ Prose.io or a similar service
+ Prismic.io or a similar service
